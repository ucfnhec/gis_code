GUI-based Map
```{r}
#install.packages("jpeg")
#install.packages("knitr", "ggplot2")
library(knitr) 
library(ggplot2)
library(jpeg)
img1_path <- "image/manchester.jpg"
img1 <- readJPEG(img1_path, native = TRUE)
include_graphics(img1_path)

```
This map is produced by QGIS, basically including the census data and boundary data. The density is calculated by population divide area. The illustration of the map follows graduated scheme and applies quantile to divide the data into five groups. This map indicates how people gathering in different locations in Manchester.




code-based Map
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(geojsonio)
library(sf)
library(tmap)
library(tmaptools)
#read some data attributes
LondonData <- read_csv("https://files.datapress.com/london/dataset/ward-profiles-and-atlas/2015-09-24T14:21:24/ward-profiles-excel-version.csv", na = "n/a")
#read some geometries
EW <- geojson_read("http://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/8edafbe3276d4b56aec60991cbddda50_2.geojson", what = "sp")
#pull out London
LondonMap <- EW[grep("^E09",EW@data$lad15cd),]
#convert to a simple features object
LondonMapSF <- st_as_sf(LondonMap)
#append the data to the geometries
LondonMapSF <- append_data(LondonMapSF,LondonData, key.shp = "lad15cd", key.data = "New code", ignore.duplicates = TRUE)
#plot a choropleth
qtm(LondonMapSF, fill = "% Not Born in UK - 2011")
